Want to grow the civic technology industry, while learning more about it? The University of Chicago is starting a class this spring to train its masters students in data science and public policy in how to build tech that matters. 

Taught by former ED of Code for America, CDO of LA, and CIO of Sacramentao, Abhi Nemani, the Civic Technology course is a first-of-its-kind opportunity to train the next generation of civic tech leaders. Abhi is looking for a teaching assistant to help with course planning, teaching, and student engagement, with a focus on technical skills (data scraping/warehousing and app dev). This is a paid position for a 10 week course, with the expectation of 5-6 hours a work a week. More information on the course is available [online](https://abhinemani.com/civictechcourse), and anyone interested should contact Abhi Nemani at abhniemani@uchicago.edu.
