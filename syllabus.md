The course will be organized to provide students with the context, techniques, and capabilities to build effective civic technology. Pulling from the best practices of the consumer tech industry and the nuances of the civic space tech, the course is organized around four central themes from start to finish in the product life-cycle: 1) identifying opportunities, to 2) developing a conceptual design; 3) gathering and wrangling data; and finally 4) delivery. The following list of topics / questions form the arc of the course, which will be spread across 10 weeks.
 
What is civic tech? [Opportunity]
Moral, practical, and business motivations for civic technology
Relationship between policy and technology for outcomes (eg Healthcare.gov)
Landscape review of existing solutions
What’s different? [Opportunity]
Technical overview of existing systems / languages within government (eg COBOL, Java, etc)
Key cultural distinctions between civic and consumer tech: access, literacy, language
Who are you building with and for? [Design]
Lean / agile development methodologies
User research in the civic technology space
What do you need to get started? [Data]
Data extraction methodologies
Understanding and using Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
Understanding and building Demilitarized Zones (DMZs)
How do you piece things together? [Data & Design]
ETLs / Data wrangling (Python)
Data warehousing (PostgreSQL)
Application development (Javascript / Python)


How do you get to your users? [Delivery]
Lean / agile metrics for measuring engagement (ie AARRR)
Civic marketing tactics: government “real estate”, upsells, defaults
How do you ensure sustainability? [Delivery]
Model: In-house/training (government) vs B2G vs B2B vs B2C; open vs closed source
Funding: private, government, foundation, citizen, hybrid
 
(These technical and operational tactics, generalized, should be useful not only in the development of civic tech, but any product.)
