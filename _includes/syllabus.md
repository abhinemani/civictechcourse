The course will be organized to provide students with the context, techniques, and capabilities to build effective civic technology. Pulling from the best practices of the consumer tech industry and the nuances of the civic space tech, the course is organized around four central themes from start to finish in the product life-cycle: 1) identifying opportunities, to 2) developing a conceptual design; 3) gathering and wrangling data; and finally 4) delivery. The following list of topics / questions form the arc of the course, which will be spread across 10 weeks.
 
1. What is civic tech? [Opportunity]
- Moral, practical, and business motivations for civic technology
- Relationship between policy and technology for outcomes (eg Healthcare.gov)
- Landscape review of existing solutions

2. What’s different? [Opportunity]
- Government vs Citizens vs Consumers
- Technical overview of existing systems / languages within government (eg COBOL, Java, etc)
- Key cultural distinctions between civic and consumer tech: access, literacy, language

3. Who are you building with and for? [Design]
- Lean / agile development methodologies
- User research in the civic technology space

4. Can / should you build? 
- Build vs buy & governmental decision-making
- Data availability and sources
- Shortcomings in the data landscape

5. What do you need to get started? [Data]
- Web scraping methodologies
- Data extraction methodologies
- Understanding and using Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
- Understanding and building Demilitarized Zones (DMZs)

6. How do you piece things together? [Data & Design]
- ETLs / Data wrangling (Python)
- Data warehousing (PostgreSQL)
- Application development (Javascript / Python)

7. How do you get to your users? [Delivery]
- Lean / agile metrics for measuring engagement (ie AARRR)
- Civic marketing tactics: government “real estate”, upsells, defaults

8. How do you ensure sustainability? [Delivery]
- Model: In-house/training (government) vs B2G vs B2B vs B2C; open vs closed source
- Funding: private, government, foundation, citizen, hybrid
 
*(These technical and operational tactics, generalized, should be useful not only in the development of civic tech, but any product.)*
